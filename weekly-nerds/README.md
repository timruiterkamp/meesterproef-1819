# Weekly nerds

Almost every week of the minor webdevelopment at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences we had the possibility to visit a talk from people in our workfield. And at the end of the minor we started visiting companies to gather information about the companies, this was also a great way to find an internship.

Part of the weekly nerds were to write 3 articles, the articles can be found at the links below:
